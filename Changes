    -  Updating to work with newest versions of 
       Perl::Dist classes.

0.202   Sat 26 Sep 2009
    -  Bug fix. (test_verify_portability was not fully 
       implemented.)

0.201   Sun 13 Sep 2009
    -  Bug fix. (create_test_class_long added 8 to the 
       count, but did only 7 tests.)

       suspecting it.
