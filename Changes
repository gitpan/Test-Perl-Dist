Changes for Perl extension Test-Perl-Dist

0.300   Thu 22 Apr 2010
    -  Now works with xt directories.
       THIS REQUIRES AN INCOMPATIBLE API CHANGE.
    -  Catches error that Perl::Dist::WiX::Toolchain gives when the 
       blib directory does not exist during testing (because one of 
       the Process modules assumes that it needs -Mblib to run.)

0.203   Sat 20 Mar 2010
    -  Updating to work with newest versions of 
       Perl::Dist classes.

0.202   Sat 26 Sep 2009
    -  Bug fix. (test_verify_portability was not fully 
       implemented.)

0.201   Sun 13 Sep 2009
    -  Bug fix. (create_test_class_long added 8 to the 
       count, but did only 7 tests.)

0.200   Sat 12 Sep 2009
    -  Initial release. Unfortunately, the world was 
       suspecting it.
